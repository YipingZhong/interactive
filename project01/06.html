<h1>A Boat</h1>
<br>
<div>
<h2>O beautiful</h2>
was the werewolf<br>
in his evil forest.<br>
</div>

<div>
<h2>We took him</h2>
to the carnival<br>
and he started<br>
<strong>crying</strong><br>
when he saw<br>
<em>the Ferris wheel.</em>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Electric</h2>
green and red tears<br>
flowed down<br>
his furry cheeks.<br>
</div>

<div>
<h2>He looked</h2>
like a <em>boat</em><br>
out on the dark<br>
<strong>water.</strong><br>
</div>
