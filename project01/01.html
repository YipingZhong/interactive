A Boat<br>
<br>
O beautiful<br>
was the werewolf<br>
in his evil forest.<br>
We took him<br>
to the carnival<br>
and he started<br>
crying<br>
when he saw<br>
the Ferris wheel.<br>
Electric<br>
green and red tears<br>
flowed down<br>
his furry cheeks.<br>
He looked<br>
like a boat<br>
out on the dark<br>
water.<br>
